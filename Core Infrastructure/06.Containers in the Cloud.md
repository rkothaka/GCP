IaaS: Share compute resources with other developers by using Virtual machines to virtualize the hardware.
The idea of a container is to give the independent scalability of workloads in PaaS and an abstraction layer of the OS and hardware in IaaS.
A configurable system lets you install your favorite runtime, web server, database, or middleware, configure the underlying system resources, such as disk space, disk I/O, or networking, and build as you like.
The smallest unit of compute is an app with its VM. The guest OS might be large, even gigabytes in size, and take minutes to boot. As demand of your application increases, you have to copy and entire VM and boot the guest OS for each instance of your app, which can be slow and costly.

With App Engine, you get access to programming services, so you only need to write your code in self-contained workloads that use these services and include any dependent libraries.
This scales rapidly, but there's no option to fine-tune the underlying architecture to save cost.

For microservices: modular, easily deployable, and scale independently across a group of hosts

### Kubernetes
- Open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services
- Makes it easy to orchestrate many containers on many hosts, scale them as microservices, and deploy rollouts and rollbacks.
- Is a set of APIs to deploy containers on a set of nodes called a cluster
- Divided into a set of primary components that run as the control plane and a set of nodes that run containers.
- You can describe a set of application and how they should interact with each other and Kubernetes figures how to make that happen.

A pod is smallest unit in Kubernetes that you can create or deploy
