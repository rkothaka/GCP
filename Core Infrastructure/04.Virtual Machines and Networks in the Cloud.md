Project - Virtual Private Cloud
Custom VPC or Default VPC

### VPC
A secure, individual, private cloud-computing model hosted within public cloud
	Run code, store data, host websites, and anything else that can be done in an ordinary private cloud.
	A VPC is hosted remotely by a public cloud provider.
VPC
	VPC networks connect Google Cloud resources to each other and to the internet
	Segmenting networks
	Using firewall rules to restrict access to instances
	Creating static routes to forward traffic to specific destinations.
	Google VPC networks are global and can have subnets in any Google Cloud region worldwide.
Retain a simple network layout and build resilient solution with VMs across multiple regions but on single subnet.

### Compute Engine
Google IaaS solution
	Can create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure
	No upfront investments
	Thousands of virtual CPUs can run on a system that's designed to be fast and to offer consistent performance.
	Each VM contains the power and functionality of a full-fledged operating system.
	Can be configured like a physical server.
Virtual Machine
	Can be created using the Google Cloud console, CLI, or the compute engine API
	Can run Linux and Windows Server images provided by Google or any customized versions of these images
	Can build and run images of other operating systems and flexibly reconfigure VMs.

**Scaling Virtual Machines**
Autoscaling: Resilient and scalable apps
Max Number of CPUs per VM:
	tied to its machine family
	constrained by the user's quota (which is zone dependent)
Google's VPC supports several different types of load-balancing

**Virtual Private Cloud compatibility**
	Routing tables are built-in
	No router provisioning or managing
	Forward traffic from one instance to another
	No external IP address is required
Firewall
	No router provisioning or managing
	Restrict access to networks
	Rules can be defined through network tags

VPC Peering: establish relationship between two VPCs. (case where there are multiple projects)
Alternatively, look into Shared VPC

### Cloud Load balancing

Fully distributed, software-defined, managed service
You can put Cloud Load Balancing in front of all your traffic:
	HTTP(S)
	TCP traffic
	SSL traffic
	UDP traffic
Provides single as well as cross-region load balancing, including automatic multi-region failover
Global HTTP(S) , Global SSL Proxy, Global TCP Proxy, Regional, Regional internal

**Cloud DNS and Cloud CDN**

### Connecting networks to Google VPC
On-prem to Google Cloud
	VPN
		Uses Cloud Router to make connection dynamic
		Lets other networks and Google VPC exchange route information over the VPN using the Border Gateway Protocol
		Not always the best option because of security concerns or bandwidth reliability
	Direct Peering
		Puts a router in the same public datacenter as a Google point of presence (PoP)
		Uses a router to exchange traffic between networks
		More than 100 Google PoP around the world
	Carrier Peering
		Gives direct access from an on-premises network through a service provider's network
	Dedicated interconnect
		Allows for one or more direct, private connections to Google
		Can be covered by up to 99.99% availability
		Can be backed up using a VPN
	Partner Interconnect

### Lab Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:
- Explore the default VPC network
- Create an auto mode network with firewall rules
- Create VM instances using Compute Engine
- Explore the connectivity for VM instances

Quiz
Virtual private cloud (VPC): 
Networks are global, and subnets are regional.
