Customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service.
	Through web interface, users get the processing power, storage, and the network they require without human intervention
Customers get access to those resources over the internet from anywhere
The provider of those resources allocates them to users out of that pool.
Resources are elastic-which means they're flexible, so customers can be
Customers pay only for what they use, or reserve as they go

Colocation -> Virtualized data center -> Container-based architecture

### IaaS vs PaaS
**IaaS offering provide:**
Raw Compute, Storage, and Network Capabilities (similar to the datacenters)
Pay for resources allocated
**PaaS**
Bind code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure that app needs
Allows more resource to focus on app logic
Pay for the resources used

### Serverless Cloud Computing
Allows developers to concentrate on code
No infrastructure management needed
e.g.:
Cloud functions: Manages even-driven code as a pay-as-you-go service
Cloud Run: Deploy containerized microservices based applications in a fully-managed environment.

### The Google Cloud Network
Highest possible throughput
Lowest possible latencies
100+ content caching nodes worldwide
High demand content is cached for quicker access

**App location affects:**
Availability
Durability
Latency

Location -> Regions -> Zones
Multi-Regions
