- App Engine is a fully managed, serverless platform for developing and hosting large-scale web applications.
- With App Engine, you can choose from popular coding languages, libraries, and frameworks to develop apps with tools you're familiar with.
- Once the code is uploaded, Google manages the app availability.

App Engine provides built-in services and APIs like:
- NoSQL data stores
- Memcache
- Load balancing
- Health checks
- Application logging
- User auth API

You can use the Cloud Console web-based interface to create new applications, configure domain names, change which version of your application is live, examine access and error logs and much more.

Two types of App Engine environments:
1. Standard: environment features include:
	- Persistent storage with queries, sorting, and transactions
	- Automatic scaling and load balancing
	- Asynchronous task queue for performing work outside the scope of a request
	- Scheduled tasks for triggering events at specified times or regular intervals.
	- Integration with other Google Cloud services and APIs
	- Requirements:
		- Use specified versions of Java, Python, PHP, Go, Node.js, and Ruby
		- Application must conform to sandbox constraints that are dependent on runtime.
	- Steps:
		- Develop web app and test locally
		- Deploy to App Engine with SDK
		- App Engine scales and services the app
2.  Flexible Environment
	- Let you specify the container your web application will run in. This option lets an application run inside Docker containers on GCE VMs.
	- Supports:
		- Microservices
		- Authorization
		- SQL & NoSQL databases
		- Traffic splitting
		- Logging
		- Search
		- Versioning
		- Security Scanning
		- Memcache
		- CDNs
	- Benefit from custom configurations and libraries while focusing on writing code.
	- Customize the runtime and the OS of your VM.
	- Customize or provide runtimes by supplying a custom Docker image or Dockerfile.

### Google Cloud API Management
Cloud Endpoints and Apigee API Management: These are tools for Google Cloud's application programming interface or API.

### Cloud Endpoints:
- Distributed API management system that uses a distributed Extensible Service Proxy, a service proxy running in its own Docker container.
- Provides an API console, hosting, logging, monitoring, and other features.
- Use with any APIs that support the OpenAPI specification
- Supports applications running in App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, and Compute Engine.
- Clients include Android, iOS, and JavaScript.

### API Gateway
- Backend implementations can vary for a single service provider.
- Provide secure access to your backend services through a well-defined REST API
- Client consumes your REST APIs to implement standalone apps.

### Apigee API Management
- Specific focus on business problems, like rate limiting, quotas, and analytics.
- Many Apigee API management users provide a software service to other companies
- Backend services for Apigee API Management don't need to be in Google Cloud

## Cloud Run
- A managed Compute platform that can run stateless containers
- Serverless, removing the need for infrastructure management
- Built on Knative, an open API and runtime environment built on Kubernetes
- Can automatically scale up and down from zero almost instantaneously, charging only for the resources used.

Write your code -> Build and package -> Deploy to Cloud Run
Source Code.     -> Container image.    -> Web App
listens for web req. 

Cloud run can only deploy images that are stored on the Artifact Registry
Cloud Run then starts your container on demand to handle requests and ensures that all incoming requests are handled by dynamically adding and removing containers.

With Cloud Run, you can use a container- and source-based workflow. Cloud Run can also use build packs to containerize your Source code.
Ensures that container image is secure, well configured, and built consistently.

Cloud Run handles HTTPS serving for you. This means you only have to worry about handling web requests and you can let Cloud Run take care of adding the encryption. 

By default, your application is exposed to a unique subdomain of the globalrun.appdomain. 

You can also use your custom domain. Cloud Run manages everything else: generating a valid SSL certificate, configuring SSL termination correctly with secure settings, handling incoming requests, decrypting them, and forwarding them to your application. 

The pricing model on Cloud Run is unique as you only pay for the system resources you use while a container handles web requests with a granularity of 100 milliseconds and when it's starting or shutting down. 

You only pay for something if your container handles requests. Additionally, there was a small fee for every one million requests you serve. 

The price of container time increases with CPU and memory. A container with more vCPU and memory is more expensive.

The cloud can allocate 4 vCPU and 8GB as memory.

## Lab: Hello Cloud Run
### Objectives

In this lab, you learn to:

- Enable the Cloud Run API.
- Create a simple Node.js application that can be deployed as a serverless, stateless container.
- Containerize your application and upload to Container Registry (now called "Artifact Registry.")
- Deploy a containerized application on Cloud Run.
- Delete unneeded images to avoid incurring extra storage charges.

# Copy application dependency manifests to the container image.
# A wildcard is used to ensure copying both package.json AND package-lock.json (when available).
# Copying this first prevents re-running npm install on every code change.

# If you add a package-lock.json, speed your build by switching to 'npm ci'.
